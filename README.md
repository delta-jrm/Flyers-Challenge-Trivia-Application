Application to solve questions in an efficient manor. Made for the purpose of the Flyer Challenge at Lewis University.

Version 1: 12/1/2019
- Added feature to input searches for keywords
- Added feature to select wikipedia page by inputting index of correct term
- Added feature to print out wikipedia page
- Added feature to search for answers individually (done through for loop)
- Added feature to see if page contains answer, and outprinting 300 characters before and after the answer.

- ToDo: Capitalize the answer when outprinted for easier reference
- ToDo: Assure all occurances of the answer are checked on the page
- ToDo: Iron out kinks in wikipedia search function, create escape or restart command if needed
- ToDo: Create answer object to have all answers run in a multithreaded fashion to speed up the process
- ToDo: Add menu to either select Wikipedia Scraping or Database Comparison until both are functional.
- ToDo: Once both are functional, run both processes in paralell to maximize chances of finding answer in quick fashion
- ToDo: Add functionality to crosscheck with the database of questions and answers
- ToDo: Start building GUI interface for inputting key terms and questions if possible.

- Goal: Implement more object oriented design strategy and investigate multithreading both methods of checking answers.
- Goal: Optimize search through with use of key terms, but make sure valid questions are not being ignored
